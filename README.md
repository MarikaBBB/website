# WEBSITE PROJECT

Welcome to my Founders & Coders Portfolio! This is a web page created by me, Marika Bertelli, to showcase my skills, projects, and learning journey. This portfolio serves as a playground for me to explore and demonstrate my knowledge of web development concepts. At the same time, the website is designed to allow visitors to learn more about me.

### Usage

To view my portfolio, simply visit the GitHub page: https://marikabbb.github.io . 
The portfolio is responsive and can be accessed on different devices and screen sizes (work in progress).  

 

### Overview

I built my portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a responsive layout and follows best practices in web development. The portfolio consists of different sections that provide information about me, my projects, testimonials, and a contact form.

The main goal of this project was to showcase my personality and creativity through the website. I wanted it to be unique and engaging for visitors. To achieve this, I added smooth scrolling, animations, and hover effects to make the website visually appealing and interactive. I also made sure to prioritize accessibility by following guidelines for color contrast and inclusivity.

Instead of using traditional portfolio templates, I decided to be more creative. I used an avatar and an interactive map to make the portfolio more interesting and to spark curiosity.

### Sections

- Header Section: This section contains a navigation bar with links to different sections of my portfolio, such as About Me, Projects, Testimonials, and Contact. This allows visitors to quickly explore different areas of my portfolio.
- Title Section: A visually appealing section with a welcome message, my name, and a motivational quote.
- About Me Section: This section provides an introduction to who I am, including my avatar and interactive elements that reveal more information when clicked. This section aims to provide a personal touch and give visitors an understanding of my journey as a self-taught beginner developer.
- Image Map Section: An interactive image map displaying different countries and locations that I have a connection with. Clicking on each location reveals a popup window with additional details.

### Features
Throughout the website, I have incorporated interactive elements like animations and hover effects to enhance the user experience and make the website visually engaging. I used a combination of CSS and JavaScript techniques.

- Animating Avatars: Clicking on an avatar triggers an animation effect, adding visual appeal to the web page.
- Speech Bubble: A speech bubble appears when the user scrolls to a specific section of the web page, creating a dynamic visual cue.
- Pop-up Windows: Clicking on flag icons opens pop-up windows with detailed information about me.
- Project Carousel: A looping carousel showcases your projects, allowing users to navigate through them and view project details.
- Smooth Scrolling: Clicking the "Start My Story" button smoothly scrolls to the image map section and open the first po-up window.
- Image Sources: I used Freepik for finding images (https://www.freepik.com) and Pixton (https://app.pixton.com/#/) for creating my avatar.

### Challenges

- Integration: Integrating multiple features smoothly and ensuring they work together without conflicts or unintended behavior.
- Debugging: Identifying and resolving issues related to event listeners, class toggling, and element visibility.
- Managing Element Layout: Aligning and positioning elements within the website layout while maintaining responsiveness was a challenge. I had to carefully consider and test the spacing and alignment to ensure consistency across different devices.
- Styling Complex Interactive Components: The project carousel and hover boxes was quite complex for me. I had to test and address potential cross-browser compatibility issues.
- Managing Class and ID Names: As the codebase grew longer and more complex, I encountered challenges in managing and avoiding conflicts with class and ID names. I had to review the code multiple times to maintain consistency and ensure unique names for each element to prevent unintended style clashes and JavaScript errors.
- Organizing Styles and Selectors: As the CSS file expanded, organizing styles and selectors became a challenge. I have to structure my CSS code thoughtfully (work in progress).
- Responsive Design: Ensuring the features work well on different screen sizes and adjusting layout accordingly. (work in progress)

### What I Learned
While working on this code, I learned several key concepts in JavaScript and CSS, including:

- Event handling: How to handle user interactions such as clicks and scrolls.
- DOM manipulation: How to select and modify elements on the web page using JavaScript.
- CSS animation: How to apply and toggle animation classes to create visual effects. Working with advanced selectors like ```:hover``` and ```:nth-child``` in CSS expanded my knowledge of CSS selectors.  
- Scroll detection: How to detect the user's scroll position and trigger actions accordingly.
- Conditional statements: How to utilize switch statements to perform different actions based on specific conditions.
- ```@keyframes```: I learned how to use the ```@keyframes``` rule to create animations in CSS.
- Accessibility: I explored the WCAG guidelines for color contrast and learned how to make my website more accessible.

Here are some articles and tutorials that were particularly helpful in building features for my website:

I also used WebGradients (https://webgradients.com/) as a resource for background gradients.

### Debugging

- Missing CSS Classes: Ensuring that the necessary CSS classes are correctly assigned to elements for animations and visibility.
- Event Listener Placement: Verifying that event listeners are correctly placed and attached to the intended elements.
- Incorrect Element Selection: Ensuring that the correct DOM elements are selected and manipulated in the JavaScript code.
- Logical Errors: Identifying and fixing logical errors in conditional statements, switch cases, and function calls.
- CSS Styling Conflicts: Resolving conflicts between different CSS styles that may interfere with the desired layout or functionality
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring consistent CSS styles across different browsers presented a debugging challenge. To address this, I tested my website on multiple browsers and devices to identify and resolve any styling inconsistencies or compatibility issues.
- Layout, Alignment and Styling Issues: I used the browser developer tools to inspect and troubleshoot elements, adjust styles, and ensure proper alignment and visual consistency across different devices and browsers.

### APRIL 2023 - before starting the website project...

When I finished my first project, I decided that I wanted to create different folders for each project under the same repository on GitHub Pages. I thought it would be a good idea to create a new landing page (index.html) where I could store links to each project's web pages.

However, changing the structure of my GitHub repository turned out to be more challenging than I thought. As someone who is relatively new to Git and GitHub, I had to follow a few steps to achieve my goal:

- I created new folders for each project and moved their respective files into these folders. This was a bit tricky because I had to use the "git mv" command in the command line to move the files or drag and drop the files in the Github Desktop application.
- I adjusted the necessary paths in the code to reflect the new folder structure.
- I updated the links in the index.html file to point to the correct project pages.
- I committed and pushed these changes to my GitHub repository.
- Finally, I verified that the links worked correctly by testing the website.

Overall, this experience helped me gain a better understanding of Git and GitHub, as well as the importance of planning and organizing a repository's structure from the beginning.
